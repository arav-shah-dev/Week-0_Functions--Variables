# Python Foundations

This folder contains my initial Python practice programs as part of my learning journey.

## Files

### 1. hello.py
A simple program that prints a greeting message.  
It is my first step in understanding Python syntax and structure.

### 2. calculator.py
A basic calculator program that performs simple arithmetic operations.  
This helped me learn about variables, input handling, and basic logic.

These programs are part of my computer science foundations work.
